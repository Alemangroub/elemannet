# Blueprint: Elemannet - Project & Installment Management Dashboard

## 1. Overview

This application is a web-based project management dashboard named "Elemannet". It is designed for administrators to create, monitor, and manage various construction or contracting projects, as well as handle customer contracts and installment plans. The platform provides a centralized view of all projects and contracts, with detailed pages for tracking work progress, expenses, and payment schedules. Supervisors can submit daily reports and expense claims, while administrators manage the financial and contractual aspects.

## 2. Core Features & Design

### 2.1. General Style & Aesthetics

-   **Layout:** Modern, clean, and intuitive right-to-left (RTL) layout suitable for Arabic.
-   **Color Palette:** Primarily uses a professional combination of blues for primary actions, greens for success states, reds for danger/deletion, and varying shades of gray for backgrounds and text.
-   **Typography:** Utilizes the 'Cairo' font for a modern and readable Arabic interface.
-   **Components:** Features card-based design for projects and reports, clear navigation, and responsive layouts for both desktop and mobile.
-   **Interactivity:** Smooth transitions, hover effects, and custom-designed modals for confirmations to enhance user experience.

## 3. Previous Task: Refactor Cost Pages into a Single Dynamic Route

### Plan & Steps for the requested change:

1.  **[Identify Problem]** The `src/pages/admin/projects/[id]/costs/` directory contained numerous individual, static `.astro` files for each cost type (e.g., `concrete-wages.astro`, `electrical-wages.astro`). This structure was highly inefficient, difficult to maintain, and not scalable for adding new cost categories.
2.  **[Delete Redundant Files]** Systematically deleted all the individual static cost pages from the `costs` directory to clean up the project structure.
3.  **[Create Dynamic Route]** Created a single dynamic Astro page: `src/pages/admin/projects/[id]/costs/[costType].astro`.
4.  **[Implement Dynamic Content]** This new page utilizes the `costType` parameter from the URL to dynamically fetch and display the relevant cost information. This approach simplifies the codebase, significantly improves maintainability, and allows for the easy addition of new cost types in the future without needing to create new files.
5.  **[Update Blueprint]** Updated this `blueprint.md` file to document the refactoring process and the new dynamic route structure.

## 4. Current Task: Add "Items" (البنود) Page to Projects

### Plan & Steps for the requested change:

1.  **[Add Navigation Link]** Modified the Project Details page (`src/pages/admin/projects/[id].astro`) to include a new navigation card that links to the "Items" page for that specific project.
2.  **[Style the Link]** Updated the CSS in `[id].astro` to handle a three-column layout for the navigation cards, ensuring the new "Items" card displays correctly alongside the existing "Expense Reports" and "Daily Reports" cards. Added a new CSS variable (`--items-color`) for styling.
3.  **[Create New Page]** Created a new, placeholder page at `src/pages/admin/projects/[id]/items.astro`.
4.  **[Implement Page Structure]** The new `items.astro` page includes the standard layout, authentication checks, a title, and a link to return to the main project details page. It currently contains a placeholder message indicating that the feature will be implemented soon.
5.  **[Update Blueprint]** Updated this `blueprint.md` file to document the addition of the new page and navigation link.

## 5. Current Task: Add Print and Export Buttons

### Plan & Steps for the requested change:

1.  **[Add Buttons to UI]** Added "Print", "Export PDF", and "Export Excel" buttons to the header of the `src/pages/admin/contract-details.astro` page.
2.  **[Install Dependencies]** Installed the `jspdf`, `jspdf-autotable`, and `xlsx` libraries via npm to handle PDF and Excel exporting.
3.  **[Implement Functionality]**
    -   Added a `click` event listener to the "Print" button that triggers the browser's native `window.print()` function.
    -   Created an `exportPDF` function that uses `jspdf` and `jspdf-autotable` to generate a PDF of the installments table.
    -   Created an `exportExcel` function that uses `xlsx` to generate an Excel file from the installments table.
4.  **[Update Blueprint]** Updated this `blueprint.md` file to document the new features and the steps taken to implement them.
